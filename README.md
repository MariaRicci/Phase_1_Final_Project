### Student: Maria Antonietta Ricci

This project analyzes data from BOM and IMDB databases in the timespan 2010-2018.
Business Problem: what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office.

### Hypothesis: 
- How do we measure what people like? Box office gain, Average Ratings, Votes Numbers
- if people like a movie, they will be more inclined to spend money to go the cinema
- if people like a movie, they will leave a good rating
- if people like a movie, more of them will be inclined to vote it
 
### Questions:
- How many movies were produced?
- What are the most gaining movies?
- What are the movies with the highest average ratings?
- What are the most voted movies?
- How many movies per genres were produced aka what are the most common genres?
- To which genres belong to the most voted movies?
- To which genres belong to the highest rated movies?
- To which genres belong to the most gaining movies?
- What are the relationship between the most gaining movies and their votes number?
- What are the relationship between the most gaining movies and their average ratings?
